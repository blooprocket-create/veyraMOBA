# Veyra Match Flow Bible

**Version:** 0.1 — First playable match lifecycle, voting, reconnection, AFK, and pauses  
**Status:** Current working design canon  
**Scope:** Champion-select exits, match preparation and start, disconnect/AFK recovery and personal results, remake, surrender, pause/resume votes, and match completion.

**Implementation rule:** All timings, percentages, thresholds, and penalties stated here are **initial tuning data**, never hardcoded C++/Blueprint literals. The Match system owns authoritative phase changes, voting, outcome adjudication, and orchestration. Combat/World/Economy own their respective underlying gameplay state. This document does not choose a matchmaking/rating provider, punishment escalation policy, or backend architecture.

**Related documents:** The Battleground Bible owns map structures, wave/camp schedules, and the Prime Well win condition. The Combat Bible owns damage, actual death, and control/target validity. The Economy & Progression Bible owns Gold, XP, and buyback. The Vision Bible owns vision and ward tools.

## 1. Full match lifecycle

1. **Champion select:** Players select/lock and may trade Vanguards under the Battleground Bible's mode-specific draft rules. They choose up to two initial Flux Spells free of charge before the match.
2. **Loading:** Wait for all ten connections up to a **configurable loading timeout**.
3. **Fountain preparation:** Players enter a synchronized **15–20-second prototype preparation period**. They can move **within their own fountain**, buy opening items, and allocate starting skill points, but **cannot leave the fountain**. This preparation countdown happens before the match clock starts.
4. **Live match:** When preparation ends, the fountain exits open simultaneously and the match clock begins at **0:00**. Waves, wildlife, objective openings, remake/surrender unlocks, and buyback use the authoritative elapsed match clock and their own editable timing schedules.
5. **Paused intermission:** Gameplay freezes only after an approved pause vote; the 10-minute real-time intermission countdown still runs.
6. **Match resolution:** Destruction of the enemy Prime Well or a passed surrender ends the live match. A passed remake instead resolves it as no-contest, subject to individual already-applied absence penalties.

A match has **no mandatory time limit or sudden-death winner**. The 20–45-minute target describes desired balance, not a cutoff. A match can continue for hours until a valid end condition occurs.

## 2. Champion-select disconnect and dodge

- If anyone **disconnects during champion select**, cancel that selection session and return the other players to the queue; no match starts and no remake vote is needed.
- If someone **deliberately leaves champion select**, cancel the session and return others to the queue, but give the leaving player a **separate configurable queue-dodge penalty**. This is **not a match loss**, since no match began.
- Champion select's current casual/draft/ranked pick, ban, hover, lock-in, and trade rules remain governed by the Battleground Bible. This section does not add a new draft format or invent a dodge-penalty schedule.

## 3. Loading, preparation, and no-show players

- The loading screen waits for all ten up to a **tunable timeout** rather than waiting indefinitely.
- If someone never connects by that timeout, the match **still proceeds** through the defined start flow. That Vanguard is treated as disconnected at live-match start and follows the ordinary retreat/reconnect rules; its team may start a remake vote immediately at 0:00.
- The no-show player's team is not required to wait for a personal-loss penalty before initiating remake.
- During the pre-0:00 fountain preparation, players may move inside the fountain but **may not leave** until the shared preparation countdown ends.
- A player who disconnects during a live match or deliberately chooses **Leave Match** remains eligible to reconnect to the **same Vanguard and same ongoing match**.

## 4. Disconnect autopilot

- When an already-active player disconnects or deliberately leaves the live match, the Vanguard **immediately starts movement-only retreat toward a safe point behind an allied turret**.
- **After 1 minute continuously disconnected**, the Vanguard changes destination to its own fountain. If it arrives, it **remains at the fountain** until the player returns; it never automatically travels back to lane.
- Autopilot **only moves and paths**: it does not attack, cast abilities, farm, shop, allocate skills, or choose objectives.
- Autopilot grants **no teleport, special immunity, or invulnerability**. The Vanguard remains a normal, vulnerable unit, including while standing behind the turret.
- Reconnecting **immediately restores control of that same Vanguard and stops autopilot**. Reconnecting before the personal-loss threshold clears/resets the *continuous-disconnect penalty trigger*.
- If the Vanguard reaches its fountain, ordinary fountain services and protections apply as they would to a player-controlled Vanguard; being absent does not unlock extra gameplay actions.

The exact behind-turret retreat destination, fallback path if no safe allied turret exists, and pathing details must be implemented through editable map/pathing data and tested; do **not** invent a teleport or an AI combat mode to solve a pathing failure.

## 5. Connected-player inactivity and absence accounting

### 5.1 AFK detection and recovery

- A connected player is flagged AFK after a prototype **90 seconds of Vanguard inactivity**. **Shop browsing and shopping do not count as Vanguard activity**.
- At that 90-second threshold, display a warning to the **connected** player and begin the same two-stage movement-only retreat: first behind an allied turret, then toward the fountain after another minute if inactivity continues.
- If inactivity persists for the following **60 seconds after the warning**, apply the **personal-loss penalty**. The timing remains tunable.
- Resuming meaningful Vanguard activity before the penalty removes the AFK warning/active trigger and **immediately returns control**; a player who already incurred the penalty may still resume play normally.
- Define and test genuine meaningful activity using server-validated gameplay input/participation. **Shop use alone cannot keep resetting AFK detection**, and superficial input spam should not qualify as ongoing play.

### 5.2 Disconnect penalty and warning distinction

- **Disconnected** players cannot see an in-match warning: **do not depend on warning delivery** for their penalty flow.
- Prototype disconnect penalty threshold: **150 seconds of continuous disconnection** (matching the AFK 90-second trigger plus 60-second grace period). Autopilot itself still begins immediately and changes course to fountain after 60 seconds.
- Reconnection **before** the personal-loss threshold resets the current continuous-disconnection trigger fully. Repeated short disconnects do not accumulate toward *triggering* that penalty.
- The same underlying personal-loss penalty applies to connected AFK and disconnected players. Deliberately leaving an already-started match does not bypass it.

### 5.3 Economy and cumulative absence

- A disconnected or AFK Vanguard retains **normal Gold/XP eligibility** while still in the world: e.g. ordinary living proximity XP and qualifying nearby participation Gold when physically within range, plus legitimately credited lingering DoT/summon kills/assists.
- Autopilot does **not** actively last-hit or perform actions to earn resources. Death still removes ordinary living proximity-farm eligibility, under Economy Bible rules. There is no special AFK farm-tax or XP suppression.
- Track **total cumulative absence** across the match for end-of-match forgiveness: time spent disconnected **plus** time connected but AFK. Return to meaningful play stops counting absence; shop browsing by itself does not.
- Resetting a *continuous penalty trigger* on reconnection or recovery **does not erase previous absent time** from this cumulative total.
- During an approved intermission, **all gameplay and AFK/disconnect clocks freeze**; intermission time does not count toward absence or trigger penalties. Players may reconnect while the match is paused.

## 6. Personal-loss penalty and conditional forgiveness

- Once the AFK or disconnect threshold is reached during a live match, flag that Vanguard's player for a **personal loss**, even if their teammates later win. Teammates keep the match result they actually achieve.
- A penalized player may reconnect, resume full control, and continue to help the team; **a penalty does not lock them out of the match**.
- At final result adjudication, remove the personal-loss override **only if all of these are true**:
  1. The player's team **wins the match**.
  2. Their **total cumulative absent time** is at or below a tunable **10% of the final active match duration**.
  3. After returning, they made **meaningful positive contributions to that victory**. Kills/assists, objective participation, protection/defense, utility, and other real team play may qualify; **kills are not mandatory**, particularly for support-oriented Vanguards.
- The result check is not a client-reported claim: the authoritative match/participation record determines whether contribution occurred. The detailed anti-idle/activity scoring algorithm and final contribution thresholds are **to be designed and playtested**, not silently invented by implementation.
- A team loss, a no-contest remake, excessive cumulative absence, or failure to contribute after return **does not clear** an already-applied personal-loss penalty.
- Calculate the 10% comparison using the authoritative **active match clock** (paused time excluded). Exact duration treatment for loading and fountain preparation, absence from never-connected players, and result/rating side effects require explicit match-service implementation design; do not silently count paused time as active absence.

## 7. Remake voting

- **Either team** can initiate a remake vote **from match start at 0:00 through the 5:00 initiation cutoff**. It is generally available: **no AFK/disconnect prerequisite**.
- The team **starting** the vote is the only team that votes. A majority of its five players—**3 YES votes**—passes.
- A teammate who is **disconnected when their vote is to be recorded** automatically votes **YES** on remake. An already-recorded YES or NO remains locked even if the player later disconnects. Reconnecting does not alter a locked vote.
- A remake vote lasts **up to 30 seconds**. It passes as soon as the third YES is recorded; otherwise it fails when the window ends or approval becomes impossible.
- The **5:00 cutoff applies to *starting* a vote**, not finishing it. A vote started at 4:55 may finish after 5:00.
- After a failed remake vote, the initiating team has a **1-minute cooldown** before initiating another, provided the 5:00 start window remains open. No special auto-remake follows from a failed vote.
- A passed remake ends the game as **no contest**: no team winner or loser, and no match win/loss is recorded for otherwise unpenalized players.
- **Exception:** A player whose individual AFK/disconnect loss penalty already triggered **keeps that personal loss** when a remake passes. The other players receive the normal no-contest result unless independently penalized. Remake is not a team win and cannot satisfy forgiveness criteria.
- Never turn remake into a surrender loss merely because the team's opening minutes went badly; they are separate outcomes.

## 8. Surrender voting

- Surrender becomes available at **15:00 elapsed match time**, with its own editable unlock threshold.
- Only the initiating team votes; **3 YES votes out of the five teammate slots** pass the surrender.
- A disconnected player who has not cast a vote is an **abstention** for surrender, **not** an automatic YES. An already-cast vote stays locked across a later disconnect.
- The surrender vote window is **30 seconds**. It passes immediately on the third YES, otherwise fails on expiry or when approval becomes impossible.
- After a failed surrender vote, the initiating team waits **3 minutes** before it can request another. The opposing team has its own independent voting/cooldown state.
- On success, the initiating team **loses**, and the other team **wins**. Applicable individual AFK/disconnect result overrides and possible forgiveness are evaluated using the completed match outcome.

## 9. Vote integrity and concurrent votes

- A YES/NO vote becomes **locked immediately once recorded**; later disconnection/reconnection cannot retract or replace it.
- Automatic votes are recorded according to **the specific vote type**: remake = disconnected YES, surrender = disconnected abstention, pause/resume = AFK or disconnected YES.
- A vote requiring a majority is still measured against the **full five-player team**, never the reduced set of connected players. A unanimous vote requires **all ten** participant votes, including applicable automatic YES votes.
- Votes are initiated and tallied **server-authoritatively**. The UI merely shows votes and sends the player's selected response.
- Do not allow overlapping votes to create conflicting match transitions; authoritative match state must resolve a successfully completed end-of-match vote before accepting later state-changing results. Exact vote-request concurrency and spam control beyond the explicitly decided cooldowns are implementation details still to be specified.

## 10. Pause and resume

### 10.1 Starting a pause

- A pause vote may be requested while a live match is running. Gameplay **continues normally during the vote**; simply requesting a pause never freezes a fight.
- A pause vote lasts **up to 60 seconds**. It succeeds **only when all ten player votes are YES**.
- Players who are **AFK or disconnected automatically count as YES** for pause votes. Their automatic YES is locked once recorded; if they reconnect, they can request a separate early-resume vote during intermission.
- Failure/expiry starts a **3-minute pause-vote cooldown** before another attempt. It is a provisional, data-driven value.
- **No pause cooldown after a successful pause**, and **no limit on successful pauses per match**. A new pause may be requested again after play resumes; unanimous approval is required each time.

### 10.2 Intermission / suspended game state

- On unanimous approval, enter a **10-minute real-time intermission** (prototype editable duration).
- **All mutable gameplay state and all gameplay time stop:** player/autopilot movement; combat and target selection; healing/regeneration; skills and skill allocation; Gold/XP awards, purchasing, selling, queue delivery and swaps; objective and wave spawn timers; respawn/buyback/ability cooldowns; AFK and disconnect penalty clocks; and the elapsed match clock.
- The paused match does **not** offer a special shop phase. Gameplay actions remain frozen even for players in the fountain.
- **Only out-of-game/session functions remain available**, such as reconnecting, communication, and voting to resume. The **real-time intermission countdown** continues so an unanswered pause cannot freeze the match indefinitely.

### 10.3 Resuming

- The match **automatically resumes** when the intermission's 10-minute real-time duration expires.
- A player may request an **early-resume vote** during intermission. **All ten player votes must be YES** to resume early; AFK and disconnected players automatically vote YES. Recorded votes are locked.
- When the match resumes, gameplay and all frozen gameplay clocks continue from their saved values—not from elapsed real-world paused time.
- **No cooldown between completed pauses**. The failed-pause-vote cooldown concerns starting another *pause* after an unsuccessful vote, not early-resume voting.

## 11. Match completion and result precedence

- Destroying the enemy Prime Well grants the attacking team the match win under Battleground Bible vulnerability/defense rules. A passed surrender gives the non-surrendering team the win. No elapsed-time limit chooses a victor.
- A passed remake is **no contest** except for players with an already-triggered individual absence-loss penalty.
- Personal loss applies to its penalized player, **not automatically to their four teammates**. A successful team win may remove that player's personal loss **only** by satisfying the specific cumulative-absence and comeback-participation conditions in §6.
- A revival-style combat save is **not** a match respawn. Buyback and ordinary respawn obey Economy/Combat Bible rules and never reset an absence penalty.

## 12. Tuning, tests, and deliberately open questions

**Every number in this document is a data-driven prototype setting**, including fountain countdown, loading timeout, first/second autopilot stage, inactivity threshold, warning grace, disconnect penalty threshold, remake/surrender/pause unlocks, vote timeouts, failed-vote cooldowns, intermission duration, and the forgiveness percentage.

Implement automated tests for: disconnection across 60/90/150-second boundaries; reconnect/reset versus cumulative absence; AFK shopping inactivity; movement-only retreat and loss of enemy tower protection on step-out; Gold/XP while absent; vote locks and auto-YES distinctions; vote cutoff versus completion; no-contest plus penalized-player loss; pause freezing **all gameplay timers** but not its real-time countdown; early resume; and final forgiveness for a returning non-kill support contribution.

**Still open—not to be improvised as canon:** precise activity/contribution anti-abuse criteria; loading timeout value; detailed queue-dodge penalties; how reconnect/no-show behavior interacts with the pre-match loading/preparation boundary; pause/resume UI and early-resume voting timeout; concurrency rules for simultaneous pause/remake/surrender requests; and persistence/rating calculations for individual losses, forgiveness, and no-contest remakes. These choices can be specified when the first playable and match service require them.
